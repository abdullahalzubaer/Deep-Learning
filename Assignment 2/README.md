# Short description of each task
Details are available (where necessary) inside each task folder

Implemented in Tensorflow 2.0.0

## Task 1
---
Integrating tensorboard to monitor 

1. Training image
2. Training accuracy
3. Training loss
4. Weights
5. Gradients

For MNIST dataset calssification using MLP, implemented at a very low level (custom training loop with tf.GradientTape()).

## Task 2
---
Five files that has errors based on the choice of model architecture, hyperparameters etc and fixing them (through visualization via tensorboard and intuition) 

## Task 3
---

Classication of MNIST by using tf.data module and custom training loop - A very low level implementation

## Task 4
---

Playing around with shuffle, repeat and batch.
