# Deep Learning

This repository is used for the assignments' solution in Introduction to Deep Learning course offered at OVGU in Summer 2020.

Short description of each task

Details are available inside each Assignment folder

Implemented in Tensorflow 2.0.

## Assignment 1
---

For MNIST dataset, implemented at a very low level (custom training loop with tf.GradientTape()) using Tensorflow 2.0 without keras functionality.


## Assignment 2
---

1. Tensorboard integration
2. Solving erros in 5 files with explanation
3. Classification of MNIST using tf.data module and low level implementation
4. Playing around with shuffle, repeat and batch

## Assignment 3
---

CNN built with certain keras functionality trained on MNIST, CIFAR10, CIFAR100 but using custom training loop with tf.GradientTape()
