# DenseNet-121 Implementation 

Dataset: Cifar100





###  TODO
* [ ] Provide proper documentation in README.md
* [ ] Rerun with cifar100 and present the accuracy and loss for train, validation and test
* [ ] Implement DenseNet-169, DenseNet-201 and DenseNet-264 (report the evaluation respectively)
* [ ] Report the difference in performance between DenseNet and my previous vanilla CNN implemention w.r.t cifar100.
